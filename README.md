World Of Warcraft Add-ons and macros


Wow-Addons that I have been Working on:

SeshXP

Simple add-on that with the command /XPTotals displays the experience earned since the character logged on.
Working on implementing functionalities for gold earned during the sesh so players can gauge how much gold and experience is gotten since the last login.
